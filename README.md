# AttackGPT
AttackGPT is a web application designed to **explore the impacts of adversarial attacks on GPT-3.5 text prompts and evaluate the
robustness and reliability of ChatGPT**, an AI model designed for conversational interactions. 

The application provides a user-friendly interface for prompt selection, attack execution, and result analysis. 

2 different **types of attacks** can be performed: the self-developed Bias Attack and some existing attacks from the TextAttack framework. 

> This application was part of a final-year project which was collaboratively developed by a team of 3 students, guided by the expertise of 3 supervisors.

## Note:
The implementation of the adversarial attack is not currently usable since the API key for the GPT-3.5 model has expired.
