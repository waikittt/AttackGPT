# AttackGPT
AttackGPT is a web application designed to **explore the impacts of adversarial attacks on GPT-3.5 text prompts and evaluate the
robustness and reliability of ChatGPT**, an AI model designed for conversational interactions. 

The application provides a user-friendly interface for 
- Prompt selection
- Attack execution
- Result analysis

2 different **types of attacks** can be performed: 
- 4 existing attacks from the TextAttack framework
- A self-developed Bias Attack

> This application was part of a final-year project which was collaboratively developed by a team of 3 students, guided by the expertise of 3 supervisors.

## Note:
The implementation of the adversarial attack is not currently usable since the API key for the GPT-3.5 model has expired.
