# AttackGPT
AttackGPT is a web application designed to explore the impacts of
adversarial attacks on GPT-3.5 text prompts and evaluate the
robustness of ChatGPT, an AI model designed for conversational
interactions. The application provides a user-friendly interface for
prompt selection, attack execution, and result analysis. Two different
types of attacks can be performed, which are Bias Attack and existing
TextAttack attacks. AttackGPT is hosted on two web servers and is
accessible through URLs. However, the performance of the application
accessed through the URLs is very limited as it is hosted on free
servers, hence our team mainly runs the application locally.
