# AttackGPT
AttackGPT is a web application designed to explore the impacts of adversarial attacks on GPT-3.5 text prompts and evaluate the
robustness and reliability of ChatGPT, an AI model designed for conversational interactions. 

This application and project was developed by a team of 3 students under the supervision of 3 supervisors as a final year project.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for prompt selection, attack execution, and result analysis. 

2 different types of attacks can be performed, which are the self-developed Bias Attack and some existing attacks from the TextAttack framework. 

## Note:
The implementation of the adversarial attack is not currently usable since the API key for the GPT-3.5 model had expired.
